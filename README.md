# .png-to-HTML-CSS
I was asked to convert the .png file into HTML/CSS with MINIMUM JavaScript interaction.

First version of this challenge included coding plain HTML5 and CSS3 from scratch. No template was used in converting the .png file into HTML/CSS. 

Second version included minimum JavaScript interaction.

Third version included Responsive design of the web page in both Landscape and Portrait mode using Bootstrap.

Run index.html
